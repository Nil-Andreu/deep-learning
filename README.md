# DEEP LEARNING COURSE IN UDACITY
In this course, I will learn using Pytorch deep learning. In specific, the modules are the following ones:
0. Introduction to Deep Learning
1. Neural Networks
2. Convolutional Neural Networks
3. Recurrent Neural Networks
4. Generative Adversial Neural Networks
5. Deployment of a Neural Network

And for each of the module, i have to make a submission, which are the ones that are in this repository:
1. **Bike sharing**: Create regression with neural networks to predict bike sharing. <a href="https://github.com/Nil-Andreu/deep-learning/tree/master/submission_bike-sharing">See here</a>
2. **Image Classification**: Create a CNN to classify up to 50 classes the touristic places and also use Transfer Learning with VGG16. <a href="https://github.com/Nil-Andreu/deep-learning/tree/master/submission_landmark">See here</a>
3. **TV Script Generator**: Develop a Recurrent Neural Network to learn based on a text to develop a TV Script. <a href="https://github.com/Nil-Andreu/deep-learning/tree/master/submission_tv-script
">See here</a>

Moreover, in the course there are concepts like Autoencoders, Hyperparameter Tuning, ...
